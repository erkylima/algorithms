Project Recycle Knowledge - Algorithms and Data Structures
==========================================================

Project Description
-------------------

This project aims to provide an interactive environment for recycling knowledge in algorithms and data structures using the Python programming language. The idea is to provide practical examples, clear explanations, and challenges so that users can enhance their skills in solving problems related to algorithms and data structures.

Features
--------

*   **Sorting Algorithms:**
    
    *   Bubble Sort
    *   Merge Sort
    *   Quick Sort
    *   Insertion Sort
*   **Data Structures:**
    
    *   Lists
    *   Stacks
    *   Queues
    *   Trees
*   **Challenges:**
    
    *   Diverse set of challenges to practice the learned concepts.
*   **Clear Documentation:**
    
    *   Detailed explanations for each implemented algorithm and data structure.
